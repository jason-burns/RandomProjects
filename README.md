Programming sideprojects that I thought would be cool to knock out.


### IdleRPGRandomnessFinder
A tool to parse Discord chat logs, specifically for channels that use the [IdleRPG](https://discordbots.org/bot/idlerpg) bot.  
The bot is a simple RPG game that you can play, but also has a money system, and, more importantly, a wagering system.  You can place a bet on a coin flip, and get double your wager if you win, and lose your wager if you lose.  I noticed that some users were consistently making money off this, so there's no way it's a true 50/50 split and there must be some pattern to it.

This tool is designed to read data and load it into objects to do some science on.  The read and loading is complete, the science is to come.
